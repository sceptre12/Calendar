# Calendar

This is a simple Calendar I created for a project. 
After The project is finished I will be adding more features to the calendar so that users can add information themselves
which stays persistent on their browser unless they change it. Future features could be pulling information from a db,
special time slot notification like the browser will alert the user when an event is going to take place, they can set
how long before the even the reminder should go off. That's all folks!
