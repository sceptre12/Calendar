	This is the Js File where you can add items to the calendar.
	All that is needed is for you to type out " setEvents("firstparam","secondparam") "

	The firstparam is where you will add the first 3 letters of the month with an underscore
	and then the day in numbers.

	The secondparam is where you will add the event information in a special format.
	First: Add commas (,)  in your statement to indicate a new line.
	Second: Add semicolons (;) to indicate a new event with a comma drectly behind the semicolon.
